## Anywhere

Hey you nit-picky fella, you! You're just the kind of person we have been
looking for. You have a keen eye for design, measure-twice/cut-once,
don't mess around when it comes to keeping fonts in check, and you're a
little weird around the edges. Spot on description, huh?

Vulcan is seeking a User-Interface Designer to work on a variety of
applications, both mobile and desktop, native and web. A majority of the
apps you'd be working on are intended to be cross-platform and are made
on a client's behalf. (However, trust us when we say, there's plenty of
neat internal things, too!)

As a highly-proficient UI Designer, you'd work closely with a team of
creatives, including a director, copywriters, photographers, animators,
and illustrators. Ideally, your experience would mesh with one of the
aforementioned as well – multiple talents really shine here, especially
when layered nicely! You'll also be working extremely close with a host
of world-class software engineers, who really know their stuff. Knowing a
thing-or-two about programming works in your favor here. But, of course,
you don't need to be an expert! That's why they're here!


### About You

* You are **neat and tidy,** almost to a fault.
* You **spend more time testing and fidgeting to perfect a piece** than you
  probably should.
* **You are continually learning,** keeping up with recent trends, and
  honing your skills.
* You have **a lot of completed projects** under your belt.
* You often **work in tiers – wireframes, prototypes, branded designs,**
  animated designs, more prototypes, and final deliverables.
* **You find joy in studying how others use your design,** and use it as a
  well of knowledge to improve it.


### Requirements

* At least **2 years experience** in an agency/studio setting.
* **Shipped at least 2 applications** (web, native, mobile, et cetera).
* You **can describe with ease a focus group you have participated in**
  and how the feedback improved your product.
* You are fluent in **Sketch and Adobe Illustrator.**
* **Can quickly adapt to the workflows of others,** evolving
  with their needs.
* Familiarity with design-oriented **source control a plus**
  (e.g. – Plant).
* The ability to **adhere very closely to brand guidelines.**
* A keen **eye for the unique,** spotting trends (or setting them), before
  they become passé or over-saturated.
* Experience building programmatically-centered **prototypes a plus**
  (e.g. – React, Framer, Origami et cetera).


### Why Vulcan

* Work from anywhere.
* $2,000 birthday bonus.
* $2,000 USD annual learning stipend.
* In-office bar, available to you all day.
* 1 day per week to focus on personal projects.
* Optional medical and dental insurance.
* Parental leave.
* Catered lunch.

Vulcan is an equal-opportunity employer, and we already love you.
