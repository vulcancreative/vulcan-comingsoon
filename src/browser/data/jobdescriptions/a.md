## Anywhere

You like to write, we can tell just by looking at you. However, you're a
different breed – you enjoy creative copy and the more technical bits, be
it little bits of UI or explaining some machinery in a clever fashion. You
are capable of both lengthy write-ups and brief tweet-like summarizations,
your talent isn't limited to a certain page length. Oh, yeah. You'll do.

Our cutesy intro aside, let's talk shop. You've written engaging blog
articles before, right? Have you ever named a product? How'd it go? What
part of that one campaign did you really make shine? Brief questions, we
know, but they hold a lot of weight. Being a generalist, you should have
been to the moon and back, and are practicing holding your breath for the
next trip!

So, what will your day-to-day will look like with us? It'll be fun!
Sometimes tough, because you know… creativity is hard… but we always
find the fun in it! You'll be working next to some of the best creatives
in the industry. Well, only if you want to work in office. Entirely up to
you! Either way, you'll work directly with a Creative Director and a
team of other copywriters, creatives, and engineers in order to crank
out a variety of projects.

Essentially, if you can get up to speed on a topic quickly, write about it
at a professional (and sometimes quirky) level, and are interested in
working on a slew of different projects from a grab-bag of different
industries – this is the role for you!
