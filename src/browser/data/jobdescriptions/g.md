## Portsmouth, NH

Are you the problem solver of the design world? Do you know how to take a
feeling and conform it to a brand? How much time have you spent lately
designing icon after icon, until they come out just right? If you’re
reading this, we’re sure more than a lot. You’re a rarity, my friend. A
true master of the miniscule.

While we feel for your probable eye-strain, we also revere you for your
delicate approach at detail. You are the type of person that is capable
of taking a string of words, and boiling them down to their raw
characteristics. Followed by putting pen to paper and snapping them into
existence. (Or stylus to tablet, whatever.) In your world, if illustration
is an airy mist, iconography is a sharp rain – dense and precise, but
ever so minute, cutting straight to the core.

At Vulcan, your task will be filling in the blanks with on-brand, “it’s
amazing how it just fits in their” illustration. Not always granular, not
always grandiose, but always needed and sorely missed when forgotten. You
will work with the creative team to help plan what helps complete the
puzzle the best. They’ll paint the broad strokes you’ll make die.


### About You

  missing and where.
