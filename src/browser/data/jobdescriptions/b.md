## Anywhere

As a Social Content Designer, you know what people care about, even before
they know they care about it. You have an uncanny ability to produce
unique, trending image after unique, trending image. All are created by
hand and fit your well-developed, and ever-growing brand. Generally you
favor illustration to photography, but you make either work just as well.

Cursory introductions out of the way, let's dig a bit deeper. You can spit
out hit after hit, right? Ah, it's okay if you can't – we're a team, and

should be able to come up with an idea and execute it, at least in part.

What kind of ideas you ask? That's the very thing. We can provide a topic
and you can go to town on the specifics. Ideally, you're very good at
finding any bit value in a brand, and being able to showcase it for
the world to see! In this role – if you choose to accept – you will work
closely with a team of creatives, oftem taking a directed concept and
creating visuals to fulfill it. These visuals will be used in both
internal and client blog posts, social media postings, and newsletters.
