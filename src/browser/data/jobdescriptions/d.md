## Bangkok, Thailand

You make things tick. The API is Noah, the front-end is the whale – so, we
suppose you should be ready to play God. You have experience writing
elegant, true-to-design user-interfaces for both web and native
applications. You can spot misaligned padding from miles away, and the very
thought of a poorly timed transition makes your teeth hurt.

Having worked closely with designers and back-end nerds in the past, you
are very comfortable building a React UI to consume whatever it can throw
at you. Since you've taken a sip from the fire-hose a time or two before,
state managers, like Redux, are now second nature. Beyond that, you are
familiar with Webpack's build phases, and sometimes dabble in writing your
own extension – screw create-react-app.

Sass and brand-accurate, variable-defined colors are sweeter than ice
water on a hot day. You hardly see not repeating yourself as lazy – quite
the opposite – you find those who repeat their code a challenge to work
with, and strive to keep your workspace neat. That aside, if they can
follow the rules your linter has in-place, you'll get along swimmingly!
