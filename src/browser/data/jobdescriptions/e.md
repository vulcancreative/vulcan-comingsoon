## Bangkok, Thailand

You animate, and you yourself are very animated. When talking about a
project, almost involuntarily, you find yourself acting our the scenario.
Every motion has a meaning, and every pause just the right twinge of
tension for the given moment. You're an animator, but also love working
with user-interfaces – in your mind, it's a match made in heaven.

Now, try and sit still a moment. We're excited too! You've worked on short
films, right? How about animated prototypes for UI? Both? Excellent! Just
what we were hoping for!

Stylistically, we wouldn't be talking if you couldn't conform all of
that life-like genius to a brand. Let's just chalk that up as a given.
Man, is this going well? We feel like it's going really well. A little
more about us – at Vulcan, we'll pair you up with a team of some of the
brightest creative minds on the planet! Here you will work with other
animators, illustrators, copywriters, and sound designers, all looking to
help bring your wacky moving weirdness to life. This is going to be fun!
